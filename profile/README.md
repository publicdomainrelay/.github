  - For example: The publishers of this content relay information found other places and the work of others and active working groups (IETF, OpenSSF, etc.) into yet another jumping off location as public domain content for others to get involved with existing efforts and broadcast the work of others with the aim of alignment to preexisting widely adopted best practices. We aim to kint together existing work as much as possible and write as little new code as possible to implement secure patterns for decentralized software development.
